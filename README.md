# Feature_engineering-for-cyclical-trends

In this simple project we aim to access the impact of feature engineering on a traffic volume prediction task. 

The Idea is to generate efective features that would improve any prediction model being employed with the data available; but we also want to investigate how linear numeric encoding can miss cyclical signals in data, or with in patterns.

Hence we aim to employ simple strategies to ensure these occurances dont affect the predictions.
